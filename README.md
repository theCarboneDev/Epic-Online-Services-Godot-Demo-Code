This is the code from a video I made about Epic Online Services. It does not run on its own, however you may copy it freely if you need help setting up Lobbies or connecting to EOS.

# How to setup it up
1. Follow this video and set up a game on the EOS website: https://youtu.be/SAeroxYMa2o
2. Install the EOS Godot plugin inside of your Godot Project
3. Copy the eos_login.gd code into your project. It will NOT work as is, as it needs the value's from the site. This is normal
4. Replace all the 'EOSCredentials.X' variables with your actual values from the site. If you don't do this, it will not work. Each one has a comment like #so
